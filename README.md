## 🏗 Architecture

Easy Minutes follows a strict separation principle:

* `index.html` → UI shell only
* `storage.js` → All persistence logic

### 🔐 Core Rules

* No business data is embedded in `index.html`
* No default attendees, history, or settings are hardcoded
* No fallback persistence exists inside `index.html`
* If `storage.js` is missing, the app will not boot

---

## ✨ Features

### 📅 Meeting Management

* Auto-save draft
* Finalize to create history entry
* Load previous meetings
* Delete history entries
* Preview before finalizing

### 📌 Agenda Points

Each agenda point includes:

* Title
* Description
* Assignee (from master attendee list)
* Deadline
* Status (Open, Resolved, Blocked)
* Automatic countdown (days or calendar weeks)
* Overdue visual indicator

---

### 👥 Attendees Management

### ✅ Guarantees

## 🚀 Installation

No build system required.
